"Movement of Charged Particles" is a new project that uses Python to stimulate the movement of charged particles. This project aims to make it easier to understand and study the behavior of these particles by creating a simulation with a user-friendly interface. With this project, users can experiment with different parameters and observe how the particles move in response.
